GTM-Chat-Status-Monitor
=======================
A utility to check if GoToMeeting is in an active meeting. If it is, set chat status to "on a screen share". If it is not, and the status message is "on a screen share" then set the status back to available.

Works with OS X Messages (10.8+) and Adium (1.5)
